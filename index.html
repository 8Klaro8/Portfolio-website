						<h2>Brief Description of the app.</h2>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p class="desctiption-article">This app was 100% built by me. My goal with this was to gain
							experince
							thru creating something that I feel exciting and challenging, and also
							to have my own app as a portfolio project. Below you can see what the app is capable of.</p>
					</div>
					<h1 class="technologies-h1">Technologies used</h1>

					<div class="row aln-center">

						<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h2>API</h2>
								<p>I used the Fitness Calculator from Rapidapi</p>
								<img class="my-gif" src="rapidapi-icon.png" alt="">
								<p>The app uses the burned calorie from activity API. It calculates the burned calorie
									based
									on the user's weight and the workout's duration. The weight is given when the user
									registrates
									and the duration is a must fill in field when the user adds a new workout.</p>
							</section>

						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h2>JavaFX</h2>
								<p>First I used only Swing but I wanted to give it a better look.</p>
								<img class="my-gif" src="javafx-icon.png" alt="">
								<p>Whit JavaFx I had some challanges to implement but overall it was not difficult to
									learn it
									it is it very similar to Swing. What was challenging is to migrate the entire
									project to JavaFx, since
									the project was close to finished when I started to implement it. Definitely worth
									it.
								</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h2>Maven</h2>
								<p>I came along with Maven and I realized, better to learn it.</p>
								<img class="my-gif" src="maven-icon.png" alt="">
								<p>Some time I came along with Maven, because I needed to add a package and I realized,
									that it will be much effective if I use Maven as my build tool. It was also a
									migration but it was less time consuming. Also Maven is a tool that worth using.
									Makes the devepoling process more effective.
								</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h2>PostreSQL</h2>
								<p>The app needed a Database to save users and all their details.</p>
								<img class="my-gif" src="postgres-icon.png" alt="">
								<p>In postgres I came along with a few challanges and the biggest was JSON.
									Frist I intended to save data in JSON but I realized it is not the best practice
									so I changed to storee data in different formats.
								</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<section class="box style1">
								<h2>Detailed description</h2>
								<p>Below I go a little bit more in dept how the app works.</p>
								<p>First you find yourself on the login page where you are able to choose between login
									or register.
									If you register then you have to add a few details, including height and weight. The
									app
									uses the weight with an API and the height is there for future developing, maybe for
									an other <strong>API</strong>.
								</p>
								<p>When the user registers then the password is hashed and salted, then it stores in
									PostgreSQL with te rest of the details. I managed Postgres with
									<Strong>PgAdmin</Strong>.
								</p>
								<p>Once logged in the user is able to set his or her details on the settings page, also
									able to choose from several profile images
									and enter to the add workout page which allows the user to add new workout, edit or
									delete. The user can choose title, type, icon, and duration
									for the workout. Only title and type are editable afterwards.

					<h3>Short Description</h3>
					<p class="description-text">I started out by myself learning Python first, then Java.
						I began with courses on Udemy and as soon as I got into the
						development deeper I started out my own projects, such as
						Linked-in job applying/ saving bot, Instagram follower bot,
						fitness app - I am currently building this one.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small description-phase">
					<h3>Skills</h3>
					<p><Strong>Languages: </Strong>Java, Python, CSS, HTML</p>
					<p><Strong>Frameworks: </Strong>Flask, Bootstrap</p>
					<p><Strong>Database: </Strong>PostrgeSQL, SQLite</p>
					<p><Strong>Other technologies: </Strong>Maven, REST API, Unit test</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-8 col-6-medium col-12-small align-left  description-phase">
					<p>Once I learned th basics of <strong>Java</strong> I started to learn by building small things and
						figuring out how everything work. When I felt comfortable enough, I started to build my Fitness
						App</p>
					<p>With <strong>Python</strong> I have built several smaller and bigger projects, like insta-bot,
						twitter compain-bot, Linkedin job hunting-bot.
						I have learned more frameworks when I used Python, such as Flask and Bootstrap.</p>
					<p>I used unit test and REST API both with Java and Python. This is something I frequently.
						I also learned Maven because I saw what potential it has and how it can make my work easier to
						work.</p>
